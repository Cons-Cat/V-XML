#+TITLE: V XML

Currently, the V std lib lacks an XML parser. This is
blocker auto-generated Vulkan bindings, which would
be the start of the promised Vulkan library for V.

This repo is for a naive implementation and tests
that should be MVP for parsing =vk.xml=. I hope to
contribute it upstream at that point.
